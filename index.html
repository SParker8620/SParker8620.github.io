        <p>I began taking the course introduction to HTML/CSS. It is exciting and I never knew I would actually be pretty good at it. I am also excited to see how far I will be able to go with this. I am hoping that it will give me more opportunities in the job market.</p>

        <p>Once I finish this course through Khan academy I challenge myself to keep it up. I want to complete the entire computer programming course through Khan Academy. I am confident I can learn this if I stick to it.</p>
